## Objectives

The purpose of this course is as follows:
To provide foundational concepts for those building a product based on Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the first time.

The expected outcomes for participants are as follows:
- Understanding the components required for ML/LLM technology to operate.
- Understanding the basic vocabulary used in ML/LLM.
- Understanding how models are trained and perform inference in ML/LLM.
- Understanding the fundamental trade-offs in ML/LLM.
- Being able to estimate the schedule and cost required for ML/LLM model development during the product development process.
